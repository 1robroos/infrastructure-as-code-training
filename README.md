# Infrastructure-as-code Training

This repo contains materials for learning how to use infrastructure-as-code practices, including:

1. An [example Ruby on Rails app](/example-rails-app) used for demonstration purposes.
2. A [Packer example](/packer-example) that shows how to create an AMI that has Ruby on Rails installed and contains
   the code from the example Rails app.
3. A [Terraform example](/terraform-example) that shows how to take the AMI created by the Packer example, deploy it
   on AWS, and run the example Rails app.
